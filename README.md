## Story
Katabasis is an epic retelling of the tragic love story of Orpheus and Eurydice, where Orpheus travels the underworld in order to bring his wife back to the land of the living.

### Characters
| Name | Image | Sprite | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Orpheus** | ![](https://i.imgur.com/gcLkam2.png) | ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88259168/195715901-b653e106-21b1-4757-8e5b-6c0edad5fd40.gif) | A young and optimistic musician who sings and plays the lyre beautifully.

He becomes playful *Read: Vulnerable* when he hears Orpheus' lyre. |
|**The Fates** | *Concept Art Here* | *Sprite Art Here* | Three women who forewarn Orpheus of his **fate** throughout his journey. They can see into the future. |
| **Persephone** | *Concept Art Here* | *Sprite Art Here* | Goddess of the Spring, who was forced into Hades hand. She empathises for Orpheus and tries to help Eurydice escape the underworld.

### The Underworld

**Styx** - *Stage One: Denial* - Color: Grey
![](https://i.imgur.com/86jSFYp.png)
> Greyscale color scheme, maybe the backdrop could be a river with ghostlike skulls floating out. It would open on Charon's boat, after he realizes you have no obols, he kicks you off, you then have to find the underworld entrance, and once you find it, Cerberus blocks the way and triggers the Cerberus Boss Battle / Chase. The plot point for this stage would be Orpheus denying the fact that Eurydice died.

**Elysium** - *Stage Two: Anger* - Color: Blue
> Elysium is where mortals aspire to go. Elysium is a paradise in the afterlife meant for the heroic. I was thinking that maybe we could pull two characters from greek mythology that are happy together in Elysium, and this enrages Orpheus since he can't be with the woman he loves. Or maybe he is tricked into thinking he found Eurydice and this angers him, the boss battle triggers from him being tricked.

**Asphodel** - *Stage Three: Bargaining* - Color: Green
> Asphodel is sort of like the Limbo of Greek mythology, filled with people who weren't overly good or bad, and have lost all memories of their former life. Plot wise, Orpheus could try and bargain with the fates to try and get them to change Eurydice's fate. They deny him and another boss battle ensues.

**Tatarus** - *Stage Four: Depression* - Color: Red
![](https://i.imgur.com/TufUtku.gif)
> Tartarus is the ultimate hell of the underworld where the worst of the worst went. It holds prisons for Titans, Tantalus, Ixion and Sisyphus, one of them could potentially be a boss battle. Plotwise, Orpheus could have a breakdown after being told that his journey is meaningless and that Eurydice can never leave. It would be cool to maybe do some sort of shaky scene where the world around him is crumbling, like his mental state is.

**Hades' Palace** - *Stage Five: Acceptance* - Color: Purple
> In this stage, Orpheus finds Eurydice, there would be a boss battle with Hades, at the end of it, Orpheus plays the Lyre, and Hades caves in and cries for Orpheus. He lets him return to Earth with Eurydice on the condition that he escapes the underworld in 10 minutes and doesn't turn around to ensure that Eyurdice is following him. It would be a speed run back to Styx, and right when Orpheus gets back to the beginning, he turns around. This would be where the game ends.

#### Horror Elements
We will have to decide which elements will suit which stages best:
- cemetary / grave stones
- coffins
- black cats
- angels
- crosses
- pentagrams
- devils
- spiders
- spider webs
- heads on spikes
- dracula
- zombies
- creepy dead trees
- gargoyles
- skulls
- flames
- spikes, saws, hammers
- pitch forks
- mummies
- ghosts
- bats

## Gameplay Features

### Mechanics
- Enemies drop items (bones etc) which can be used for health, weapons, crafting
    - Bones function as arrows Orpheus can shoot
    - Chalices restore health (*we may want to make the game rougelike, which would mean permadeath if all hp is lost, we are currently thinking orpheus will have three HP, like in Cuphead*)
- Collect coins for boatman to ferry across river styx 
    - One per stage, functions to allow the player to skip stages if they have already cleared it
- The Odyssey / Fates Pages
    - The Codex Gigas idea but Greekified
    - Basically there would be lost pages and you have to collect them all
    - We could also instead of using a separate story / book have it be the Thread of the Fates, and collecting them tells the story that leads up to the beginning of the game (instead of having a cutscene in the beginning of the game)
- Difficulty levels
    - Easy
        - 5 HP, lower enemy HP 
    - Normal
        - 3 HP, normal enemy HP 
    - Hard
        - 2 HP, higher enemy HP
- Text boxes / dialogue
    - If we do fates pages I don't think there would need to be dialogue

### Movement
- Double Jump
    - If we wanted to we could use this as a feature unlocked, such as Persephone blessing Orpheus with a "Spring Jump" in the third stage
    - We could also have collectables in the first two stages that require the spring jump that way there is replayability after you clear the game, as the player would have more to explore.
- Dash with cooldown
    - Again we could use this as an unlockable feature that will increase exploration and replayability
    - "Spring Boost"
    - "Hermes' Sandals"
- Wall stick
    - Same with this
    - "Hades' Staff"

### Weapons 
- Ranged Attack
    - Bow & Arrow
- Melee Attack 
    - Sword
- Power Attack
    - Battle Axe
- Lyre
    - strings can represent different attacks
    - unlock secrets with right  sequence of chords
    - Song can make enemies fall asleep
    - Song can turn enemies into allies
    - Sort of functions for solving puzzles, such as if you are unable to cross because an obstacle blocks your way, the player would use the lyre.

### Enemies

### Bosses

- Angel of Death
- Medusa
- Arachne
- Furies

## Development

### Inspirations

We want the game to be a action platformer, I'd like to think of it as Limbo meets Hades
![](https://i.imgur.com/cfJhoJZ.png)
> Limbo

> Hades

### Animation & Sprites
Kaitlyn can potentially animate some concept art and maybe potentially sprites, but as a backup plan we could pull character models and sprites from Unity.

### Music & SFX
Ale may potentially compose some original pieces for the game, however, we should try and find copyright free music online as a backup plan just in case.

Sound effects will be pulled from Unity's catalouge

## Stretch Goals
If progress is going well, we could add the following elements:
- Opening Cutscene
- Overworld Map
    - Charon could take Orpheus to the selected stage so long as he has the coin for it, otherwise he has to start at the beginning
- Dialogue/Text Boxes
- An additional four stages (9 total, based off of the 9 circles of hell instead of the 5 stages of grief)
