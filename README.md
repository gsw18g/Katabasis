## Story
Katabasis is an epic retelling of the tragic love story of Orpheus and Eurydice, where Orpheus travels the underworld in order to bring his wife back to the land of the living.

### The Underworld

*Stage One*
![](https://i.imgur.com/86jSFYp.png)
> Takes place in the overworld in a graveyard filled with monsters. The plot point for this stage would be Orpheus denying the fact that Eurydice died.

*Stage Two*
> River with ghostlike skulls floating about. It would open on Charon's boat, after he realizes you have no obols, he kicks you off, you then have to find the underworld entrance, and once you find it, Cerberus blocks the way and triggers the Cerberus Boss Battle / Chase.

**Hades' Palace** - *Stage Three*
> In this stage, there would be a boss battle with Hades. At the end of it, Hades caves in and lets him return to Earth with Eurydice on the condition that he escapes the underworld in 10 minutes and doesn't turn around to ensure that Eyurdice is following him.

## Development

### Inspirations

We want the game to be a action platformer, I'd like to think of it as Limbo meets Hades

### Animation & Sprites
Kaitlin can animated most concept art and sprites, but some character models and sprites are from the Unity Assets store.

### Music & SFX
Ale may potentially compose some original pieces for the game, however, we should try and find copyright free music online as a backup plan just in case.

Sound effects will be pulled from Unity's catalog

## Stretch Goals
- Opening Cutscene: ACHIEVED, as well as mid-story and ending cutscenes
- Overworld Map
    - Charon could take Orpheus to the selected stage so long as he has the coin for it, otherwise he has to start at the beginning
- Points system
- Checkpoint system
- Dialogue/Text Boxes
- An additional stages with minibosses (5 total, based off of the 5 stages of grief)
