1. Programming Languages (5 points)
- We used C# scripts to control the animations of sprites (idle, walking/flying in different directions, attacking), spawning and behavior of non-player characters, camera movements, parallax scrolling of the background, interactions between the player and enemies (fighting/damage), and a health system for the player and enemies. This is the language that Unity uses to script behaviors of its assets.

2. Platforms, APIs, Databases, and other technologies used (5 points)
- The primary platform that we are using to develop this project is Unity, although we have also used Visual Studio Code to write scripts, Photoshop to edit platforms/objects, and FireAlpaca to animate sprites.

3. Execution-based Functional Testing (10 points)Describe how/if you performed functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the functional 
requirements listed in your RD). 
4. Execution-based Non-Functional Testing (10 points)Describe how/if you performed non-functional testing for your project (i.e., tested for the non-
functional requirements listed in your RD). 
5. Non-Execution-based Testing (10 points)Describe how/if you performed non-execution-based testing (such as code 
reviews/inspections/walkthroughs).
