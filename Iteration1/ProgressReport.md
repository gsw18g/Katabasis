2) Project Title and Description
- Katabasis

  - Katabasis is an action platformer based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The game will be developed using Unityâ€™s game engine and will feature 5 levels, with a miniboss at the end of each one. Unable to come to terms with the death of his wife, Orpheus enters the underworld with the hopes of bringing Eurydice back to the land of the living, weapons and Lyre in hand. However, Hades has no intentions of allowing Orpheus to cheat death. Like the original story, the game will end in tragedy.
