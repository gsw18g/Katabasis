2) Project Title and Description
- Katabasis

  - Katabasis is an action platformer based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The game will be developed using Unityâ€™s game engine and will feature 5 levels, with a miniboss at the end of each one. Unable to come to terms with the death of his wife, Orpheus enters the underworld with the hopes of bringing Eurydice back to the land of the living, weapons and Lyre in hand. However, Hades has no intentions of allowing Orpheus to cheat death. Like the original story, the game will end in tragedy.
3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment 
Describe in detail what was accomplished during this increment and where your project stands 
overall compared to the initial scope and functionality proposed.

During increment 1 we accomplished several things including setting up our github repository and taking the first steps in order to make our platformer game. The first step was to create a moveable player character with walking, jumping, and attack animations. Next we created a zombie enemy, which has walking and death animations as well as a bat enemy with its own animation. When the zombie enemy is attacked by the player, they get knocked back in the opposite direction of the attack and a floating health bar shows damage. The player character also gets knocked back when attacked by enemies. There is a health system HUD (heads up display) which shows the player how much health is remaining in the form of three hearts in the upper left corner of the screen. Parallax scrolling backgrounds were created to give the illusion of depth when moving. We also implemented a system that allows the player and enemies to walk on sloped surfaces. Overall we have a good start on creating the mechanics and objects that we will use to begin building levels and boss fights for the rest of the game.
