2) Project Title and Description
- Katabasis

  - Katabasis is an action platformer based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The game will be developed using Unityâ€™s game engine and will feature 5 levels, with a miniboss at the end of each one. Unable to come to terms with the death of his wife, Orpheus enters the underworld with the hopes of bringing Eurydice back to the land of the living, weapons and Lyre in hand. However, Hades has no intentions of allowing Orpheus to cheat death. Like the original story, the game will end in tragedy.
  
3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment 
- During increment 2 we added several things to our platformer Katabasis. We created sloped hills to give the game a more realistic look and fixed bugs to allow the player to jump on the hills. We fixed the code related to the zombie health system so that health is deducted from each individual zombie when attacked and each zombie's health bar reflects this damage. The knockback system now works, which enables the player and zombie to be knocked back when attacked. Skull platfroms which fall when the player walks on them were added to level 2. We also added new parallax scrolling backgrounds, the river styx which damages the player if he falls into it, and charon's boat. Lastly an attack patten was added to the behavior of the bat enemies.

4) Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
- Challenges
  - Very small time window to implement changes to plan based on scope of last increment
  - Based on changed workflow style (instead of each one of us doing our own level we work on the aspect of the project that we are strongest in) organization of work was mostly divided, but when we put all of our work together there were some merge conflicts
  - Combining separately done work together led to an inharmonious final product (stylistic differences in code-writing, artistic transitions between storyline and gameplay, physically transitioning between scenes using timelines, syncing music with visuals, etc.)
  - Work lost due to not saving before Unity software crash
  - Cutscenes had to be transferred over to Katabasis/Assets/Scenes manually due to previous Unity editor errors
  - Bugs: zombies walking backwards, Cerberus movement, player knockback forward instead of backwards
- Scope
  - Changed workflow style, instead of each one of us doing our own level we work on the aspect of the project that we are strongest in
  - Did not have enough time to implement syntactical/stylistic code review proposals
  - Accomplished as much as possible within 2 weeks minus time dedicated to other final exams and assignments
