2) Project Title and Description
- Katabasis

  - Katabasis is an action platformer based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. The game will be developed using Unityâ€™s game engine and will feature 5 levels, with a miniboss at the end of each one. Unable to come to terms with the death of his wife, Orpheus enters the underworld with the hopes of bringing Eurydice back to the land of the living, weapons and Lyre in hand. However, Hades has no intentions of allowing Orpheus to cheat death. Like the original story, the game will end in tragedy.
  
3) Accomplishments and overall project status during this increment 
- During increment 3 we put everything together to make a game complete with sound, music, animations, menus, and fight mechanics. Three cut-scenes were added to give background to the story. We added a menu screen with options to start a new game or quit. Clicking start brings you to the 1st level entitled "Graveyard". In this level we made an underground section including traps that kill the player if they fall into them. More health was added to the player to make it a little bit easier to play. A death screen was implemented to give the player the option to restart the game or quit upon death. We also added more functionality to the zombies to make them patrol back and forth until the player gets close which triggers their attack. In level 2 the original falling platforms were changed into two versions of different sizes. We added mechanics to charon's boat so that it starts moving when the player reaches a certain point, carries the player past several enemies, and then stops before the end of the level. We also implemented a new cerberus mini boss to the end of level 2 that dashes toward the player. The final boss battle of the game against hades was implemented with 2 attacks, a ground stab and a fireball. During the ground stab hades destroys the floor block under the player. This mechanic causes the player to have to jump carefully to avoid the holes in the floor or else they will fall to their death. Finally we made a "You Won" screen that displays after defeating hades that lets the player restart or quit the game. 


4) Challenges, changes in the plan and scope of the project and things that went wrong during this increment
- Challenges
  - Very small time window to implement changes to plan based on scope of last increment
  - Based on changed workflow style (instead of each one of us doing our own level we work on the aspect of the project that we are strongest in) organization of work was mostly divided, but when we put all of our work together there were some merge conflicts
  - Combining separately done work together led to an inharmonious final product (stylistic differences in code-writing, artistic transitions between storyline and gameplay, physically transitioning between scenes using timelines, syncing music with visuals, etc.)
  - Work lost due to not saving before Unity software crash
  - Cutscenes had to be transferred over to Katabasis/Assets/Scenes manually due to previous Unity editor errors
  - Bugs: zombies walking backwards, Cerberus movement, player knockback forward instead of backwards
- Scope
  - Changed workflow style, instead of each one of us doing our own level we work on the aspect of the project that we are strongest in
  - Did not have enough time to implement all syntactical/stylistic code review proposals or organize repository for maximum efficiency
  - Accomplished as much as possible within 2 weeks minus time dedicated to other final exams and assignments
