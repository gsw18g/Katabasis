1. Programming Languages (5 points)
- We used C# scripts to control the animations of sprites (idle, walking/flying in different directions, attacking), spawning and behavior of non-player characters, camera movements, parallax scrolling of the background, interactions between the player and enemies (fighting/damage), and a health system for the player and enemies. This is the language that Unity uses to script behaviors of its assets.

2. Platforms, APIs, Databases, and other technologies used (5 points)
- No new platforms or technologies have been used since the last increment. Unity is still the major platform we are using to develop Katabasis, and we are still using VSCode, Photoshop, and FireAlpaca for scripts, platforms, and animation. We still have not needed to used any APIs or Databases, although we are new using Logic Pro to develop music and sound for the project.
 
3. Execution-based Functional Testing (10 points)
- For every functionality we produced, we tested how the functionality works with the rest of our game to fix any new bugs that popped up and to make sure the functionality works as intended before moving on to the next.
- incremental changes were also separated into different scenes/ branches to avoid breaking the game with new code
- Functionality testing is performed by finishing a script/object, and then putting the Unity editor in play mode to analyze the behavior of our change/addition.
- Unity has its own compiler which assisted in finding any syntax errors in our scripts.
- Highest priority functional requirements were implemented and tested first and haven been the base of other requirements.

4. Execution-based Non-Functional Testing (10 points)
- We've been implementing multiple features and obstacles in order to make the experience of the player more enjoyable and have multiple interactions with the objects and enemies we've prepared.
- We've kept our code organized in multiple folders in order for it to be easily found and is documented for ease of reading and modifying.

5. Non-Execution-based Testing (10 points)
- A group member who had not previously seen code files reviewed every single script and gave feedback on syntax, design, and comments in the attached document (/Iteration2/Iteration 2 Code Review(1).pdf).
- Proposed changes from code review can be found in Katabasis/Kaitlin/proposed_scripts/
